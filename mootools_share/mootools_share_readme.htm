<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This module is based on David Walsh's <a href="http://davidwalsh.name/digg-share-widget" target="_blank">Digg-Style Dynamic Share Widget Using MooTools</a> article. It will add a share link to the bottom of your posts that acts like Digg's share button. A demo of the David Walsh method can be <a href="http://davidwalsh.name/dw-content/digg-share.php" target="_blank">seen here</a>.

<p>
I have made a few modifications to the original code, the largest change is that the Facebook link directs through fb-share-control.com. I did this because Facebook does not allow you to input title and description fields manually without a little hacking. fb-share-control.com offers a simple way for me to pass this data through, so I used them to fill in the title, url and description fields automatically.
