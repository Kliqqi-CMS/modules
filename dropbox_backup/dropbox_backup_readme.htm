<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This module takes the backup files already generated by Pligg and uploads them to your Dropbox account for safe keeping. 
Begin by using the <a href="./admin_backup.php">Admin File &amp; MySQL Backup tool</a> to create a file, avatar, or database backup. Then fill in your Dropbox credentials on the <a href="../module.php?module=dropbox_backup">Dropbox Backup page</a> and click the button to send your files to your Dropbox account. It will zip up all of the files from the /admin/backup/ directory and post them to your Dropbox account.</p>
<p>If you would like, you can customize what folder the files are placed in using the "Dropbox Directory" field. Begin this field with a forward slash when entering a subdirectory name, or remove the whole contents to place the backup file into the base of your Dropbox folder.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Make sure that both the <strong><em>/admin/backup/</em></strong> and <strong><em>/modules/dropbox_backup/backup/</em></strong> directories are set to CHMOD 777.</p>

<h3>Support</h3>
<p>If you try to "Perform Backup" and it returns a blank page, check the <a href="./admin_log.php">Error log</a> file for the most recent entry. If it shows something like: "PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'Login unsuccessful.'", then your email/password combination is probably not correct. We hope to improve this error handling down the road if we find time.</p>
<p>Some servers may return an error similar to "Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'Cannot execute request: SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details:" in their error logs. You may be able to find a solution for this after <a href="http://unitstep.net/blog/2009/05/05/using-curl-in-php-to-access-https-ssltls-protected-sites/">reading this article</a>.</p>
<p>Because this makes use of a third party service, and because it is a free module, I will not be providing support for this module. Other users are welcome to contribute their improvements and I will try to update the download.</p>
