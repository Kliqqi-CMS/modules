<h3>Description</h3>
<a href="http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/">Thickbox</a> is Javascipt written by <a href="http://www.codylindley.com/">Cody Lindley</a> and used to overlay content (images, video, etc.) on the current page.  All I've done was turn it into a Pligg module but full credit belongs to Cody.<br /><br/>

It doesn't do anything on it's own. It's designed to be used by other scripts as a "lightbox" replacement for Images, Video, etc.<br/><br/>

Not tested if Lightbox is installed and running on Pligg (used for Messaging).<br/><br/>
