	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>This module is a hack-job based on the <a href="http://forums.pligg.com/free-modules/17798-featurify-featured-content-gallery.html">Featurify module developed by CMStheme</a>. I needed to create a way for users to easily change over "featured" articles on the homepage and the Featurify module seemed like a good starting point. If you just want to rotate images representing stories I suggest that you check out Featurify.</p>
	<p>This module was designed to let users quickly display a featured article (or articles) on their homepage. It offers an admin area where you can add and edit articles, filling in title, description and image fields.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>Installation</h2>
	Open any of your Pligg template files where you want the featured article(s) to appear and put this code in:
	<pre style="padding:5px;background:#eee;">{$featured}</pre>
	<br />
	<p>I suggest that you place it on your homepage by placing it in index_center.tpl and wrapping it with the following code so that it only shows up on the homepage and not the second, third, etc. pages.</p>
	<pre style="padding:5px;background:#eee;">{if $pagename == 'index' && count($templatelite.get) == 0}<br />and don't forget to close it with {/if}</pre>
