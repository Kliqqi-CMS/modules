<strong>Description:</strong>
<p>
The Close Comments module allows you to prevent new comments from being submitted to articles on your website. You can do this one of a few ways. First, you can set it to manual mode where you will click on a link found under the story tools section for Admins. This link will disable or enable comments once again for the story that you are currently on. 
</p>
<p>
The second method involves automatically closing comments for stories that have reached a certain age. You can set how many minutes that you want to allow comments for from the module's settings page when this or the next method are in use.</p>
</p>
<p>
The third and final method for closing comments offers a combination of both features described above. You can manually close stories via a link, or they will automatically close after a specified period of time.
</p>
<p>
This module will not remove the existing comments from your site. It will only remove the comment form area so that no new comments can be posted.
